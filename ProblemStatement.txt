Company X owns a movie application and repository that caters to movie streaming to millions of users on a subscription basis. The company wants to automate the process of cast and crew information in each scene from a movie such that when a user pauses on the movie and clicks on the cast information button, the app will show details of the actor in the scene. The company has in-house computer vision and multimedia experts who need to detect faces from screenshots of the movie scene.
